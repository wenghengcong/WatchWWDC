00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,112
Hello everyone,
my name is Eric,

3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:17,050
and I'm excited to tell you how to add
accessibility to your Unity games.

4
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:22,723
Accessibility is about
allowing everyone to use our products.

5
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:27,361
And today marks a huge leap forward
for accessible gaming

6
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:31,398
with the Apple Accessibility
plug-in for Unity developers.

7
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:36,637
We will focus on three Apple technologies
for making your games accessible.

8
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:43,210
VoiceOver is a screen reader which helps
users who are blind or low vision.

9
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:47,581
It reads items on the screen
and provides custom gestures

10
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,617
for users to interact with controls.

11
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,522
Switch control, which allows someone
with low motor control

12
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,593
to use an external switch
for device interaction.

13
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:03,397
And dynamic type,
which allows people to set

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,800
the text size
according to their reading ability.

15
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,904
To get started, clone the repository

16
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,407
and build all Apple's plug-ins

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,344
using the build script
in the root of the repository.

18
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,914
This will produce a Build folder
that is ready for integration

19
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,784
into your Unity projects.

20
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:27,888
Finally, add the Accessibility plug-in
to your own project

21
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,924
using the Unity Package Manager.

22
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:35,362
For more details, look at
the documentation in the repository

23
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:39,166
and watch the video about
all of Apple's Unity plug-ins,

24
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:44,671
called "Plug-in and play: Add Apple
frameworks to your Unity game projects"

25
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:50,410
Now that you have the plug-in,
I will guide you through three areas.

26
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,313
First is accessibility elements.

27
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:56,683
This allows you to add support
to assistive technologies

28
00:01:56,717 --> 00:02:00,954
like VoiceOver or Switch Control
for your games.

29
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,857
Next is Dynamic Type.

30
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:08,095
We create this easy-to-use utility
that helps you scale text

31
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,964
according to user preferences.

32
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,600
And UI Accommodations.

33
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:18,772
These are utilities that helps you read
other user preferences.

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,775
Let's start with accessibility elements.

35
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:27,548
I built a simple card game
to help illustrate this concept.

36
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:30,551
You might see that you should tap
the "flip" button

37
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,654
to draw two random cards.

38
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,957
However, VoiceOver would not read
the text on screen

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,561
and an external switch
would not tap the button

40
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:44,097
since these are just pixels
on a screen right now.

41
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:49,136
We need to help the system understand
what can be interacted with.

42
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,039
Accessibility elements define the things

43
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:55,542
that assistive technologies can
interact with.

44
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:00,781
The text, cards, and the button on screen

45
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,750
should be accessibility elements.

46
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:07,221
And we can describe
each element with a label.

47
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:12,693
VoiceOver will read each label so the user
can understand what's on the screen.

48
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,064
And if the game supports
multiple languages,

49
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,466
we should localize these labels as well.

50
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,538
Now VoiceOver can describe
what is on the screen,

51
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:29,576
but it doesn't recognize that there's
a button that can be tapped.

52
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,346
We can use another property
called "traits"

53
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,183
to inform the system
of the element's type.

54
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,186
We should add the "Button" trait here.

55
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,156
Now, VoiceOver will read "Flip button,"

56
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,393
and an external switch
can control this button.

57
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:53,800
We can also add "Static Text" trait
on our text elements.

58
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:59,173
The "Static Text" trait is
usually given to labels and text areas

59
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:03,443
so that VoiceOver can provide
a better text interaction experience.

60
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,581
And there are many more traits
beyond "Button"

61
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,317
and "Static Text" that you can explore.

62
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,422
So what trait should we use for the cards?

63
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:21,094
Well, we don't need to use traits
on every accessibility element.

64
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,464
Our cards don't need any traits.

65
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,168
However, there's still a part of each card

66
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:31,071
that VoiceOver is not aware of:

67
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,473
the face value.

68
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:38,078
There's another property that we can
use for this called "Value."

69
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,184
Once we add a "Value" for each card,
VoiceOver will now read

70
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,654
"Card 1 with value 3 of clubs,

71
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:51,458
card 2 with value Ace of clubs."

72
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,260
And that's it.

73
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:58,065
Now that you understand the basics,
let's open Unity

74
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,934
to see how to add them to our project.

75
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:05,906
Here I am in a Unity Editor for this game.

76
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,275
I have already added
the Apple Accessibility

77
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,843
plugin to this project.

78
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,649
First we have the usual
scene objects like camera,

79
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,386
direct light, and a UI Canvas.

80
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,756
Under the canvas,
we have two text elements

81
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,925
and a button.

82
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,428
After that,
we have two game objects for cards.

83
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,235
Each is composed of two mesh components,

84
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,806
each rendering the front and back texture
for the card on each side.

85
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,311
Let's start by defining
our accessibility elements.

86
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:49,416
To do this, we need the Accessibility Node
component from this plugin.

87
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:55,055
Select all the objects in the hierarchy
that should be accessible.

88
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:02,763
And add the Accessibility Node component
to make them accessibility elements.

89
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,502
Next, we add labels.

90
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,072
Select the card object,

91
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,676
go to "Accessibility Node" component
on the right,

92
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,045
and find the "Label" field.

93
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:24,251
And make sure the label field checkbox
is checked to provide a custom label.

94
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,388
Then type "Card 1."

95
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:35,329
And the same for Card 2.

96
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:43,604
Text and buttons need labels too,

97
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:47,975
but we don't have to provide
an explicit accessibility labels for them

98
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:52,546
if we are using the standard controls
from Unity UI.

99
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,083
The plug-in already has
default implementations for those.

100
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,354
Next, we need
to add a trait to our button.

101
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,492
Select the flip button

102
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:09,229
and change the "Traits"
from "None" to "Button."

103
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,802
Select the two text elements...

104
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,241
And change "Traits" to "static text."

105
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,312
Great.

106
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:29,950
Lastly, we need to set an accessibility
Value for the card faces.

107
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,954
Since the cards are randomly drawn,
I need to add a script

108
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,023
to set the Value dynamically.

109
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:42,396
Select the two cards and add
a new script called AccessibleCard.

110
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,101
First, in one of my other C Sharp files,

111
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:53,607
I already have an enum for all
the card faces called Playing Card.

112
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,578
In my new AccessibleCard mono
behavior script,

113
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,847
we have a variable for the card type

114
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,350
and a boolean
for whether the card is facing up or down.

115
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:10,457
So now let's add
accessibilityValue to these cards.

116
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,762
First, we get the accessibilityNode
component attached to this gameObject.

117
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:21,401
Next, set the accessibilityValue
delegate to a function

118
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,837
that returns the card face value
dynamically.

119
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,809
Inside this function,
if the card is covered,

120
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,713
we return the "covered"
for the accessibilityValue.

121
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:36,817
Or if not covered,
we will enumerate all card faces

122
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,822
and return a description for each,
like "Ace of Spades."

123
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,191
And that's it.

124
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:48,395
Now let's build our project
and see it in action.

125
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:51,532
Here's our game.
Let's turn on VoiceOver.

126
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,804
Automated voice: VoiceOver on.
Eric's Game.

127
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,740
Card 2, covered.

128
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:03,076
Eric: I could swipe right
to move to the next element.

129
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,546
Automated voice: Card 1, covered.

130
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,982
Eric's card game.

131
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,386
Flip the cards.

132
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,256
Flip. Button.

133
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,661
Eric: You see that all five objects
are now accessible through VoiceOver,

134
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,163
which is awesome.

135
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:27,568
To tap the button when VoiceOver is on,
do a double-tap.

136
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,504
Automated voice: Flip.

137
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,339
Eric: Let's check the cards again.

138
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,743
Automated voice: Card 1, Two of Clubs.

139
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,681
Card 2, Ace of Clubs.

140
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:45,352
Eric: VoiceOver now reads
the updated card faces correctly.

141
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:46,386
Cool.

142
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,357
So we just made our game accessible
to millions of VoiceOver users

143
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,326
who can now fall in love with it.

144
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:57,097
And people who use external switch control
can also play our game.

145
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,367
So that was accessibility elements.

146
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,504
Next, let's talk about Dynamic Type.

147
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,975
Games can be difficult to play
for many people

148
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,978
because text is too small to read.

149
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:14,748
On iOS and tvOS, everyone can choose

150
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,985
the right text size
for their reading ability in Settings.

151
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,423
With the Accessibility Plugin,
you can read this setting

152
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:28,095
to make sure the text in your game
is displayed at the expected size.

153
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:35,169
Let's take a look at our game example
to see how we can use Dynamic Type.

154
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,441
Create a mono behavior script
called DynamicTextSize.cs.

155
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:46,213
In the start function, first store
the default text size into a variable.

156
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:51,852
Then inside the OnEnable function,
subscribe to setting changed event

157
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:57,057
using AccessibilitySettings.
onPreferredTextSizesChanged.

158
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:02,429
This allows us to update the UI as soon
as the user changes the text setting.

159
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,334
Next, inside the settingsChanged function,

160
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:11,205
first read the
PreferredContentSizeMultiplier.

161
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:14,541
Then multiply by your original text size

162
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:17,544
and assign it back to the text element.

163
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,949
Inside Unity Editor,
select all game objects

164
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:25,052
that have a Text element.

165
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,956
And add the DynamicTextSize component
that we just created.

166
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:36,730
Now our game is all set
for Dynamic type support.

167
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:41,168
Before we see the result in action,
first I am going to show you

168
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:45,205
a trick to quickly test
Dynamic Type in your games.

169
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:49,376
Open Settings, and find Control Center.

170
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:58,986
Scroll down until you see Text Size,
and add it to Control Center.

171
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:06,827
Now we can adjust text sizes quickly
by opening Control Center

172
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,996
and change the text size options.

173
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:23,744
Great–as I change the text size,
our game adjusts font sizes in real time.

174
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,648
The text percentage value shown
in Control Center

175
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,817
is exactly what we are reading
from that multiplier.

176
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:35,689
You can also adopt this setting
on non-text objects.

177
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:39,226
For example,
I can swap the card face assets

178
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,496
to Large Print when the size is increased.

179
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:50,137
First I create a script called
DynamicCardFaces.

180
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,741
Then same thing as before,
subscribe to the TextSizeChanged event.

181
00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:01,481
Instead of reading a multiplier,
I read an enum of text size category

182
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:05,619
that is mapped to the ticks
on the Control Center slider.

183
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:10,624
I could swap the asset whenever
someone selects a larger text size.

184
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,728
And I simply choose
between a regular material

185
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,563
and a large print material.

186
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,734
Now if we select a really large size...

187
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:30,010
Users would see a large print version
of the cards,

188
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:35,282
which are great card faces that are much
easier to read for people with low vision.

189
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,754
Lastly, I want to talk to you
about UI accommodation settings

190
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,223
that you can access with this plug-in.

191
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:48,662
The first setting is Reduce Transparency.

192
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:52,933
When this setting is on,
the background is turned opaque,

193
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,670
instead of a blur or transparent effect.

194
00:13:56,703 --> 00:14:01,108
It can help improve legibility when
those effects makes text hard to read.

195
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,344
To check this preference, call

196
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:08,482
AccessibilitySettings.
IsReduceTransparencyEnabled.

197
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,887
Next, the Increase Contrast setting.

198
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:18,926
Notice how the switches have
a darker grey that helps them stand out,

199
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,230
making controls easier to recognize
across the entire device.

200
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:28,802
You can increase contrast
for your own UI when this is enabled

201
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,405
by checking this setting using

202
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:35,442
AccessibilitySettings.
IsIncreaseContrastEnabled.

203
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:40,614
Next, the Reduce Motion setting.

204
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:45,586
Some people are sensitive to motion
like we have in this card flip animation.

205
00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:50,791
We should remove that animation
when Reduce Motion is enabled.

206
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,061
Let's look at the code to do this.

207
00:14:55,362 --> 00:15:00,701
In our CardController script,
we have this Flip function.

208
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:05,539
First we check if user's
reduce motion setting is on.

209
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:11,211
If not on, we should flip the card by
invoking an animation through Coroutine.

210
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:16,283
Otherwise we just set the rotation,
and no animations.

211
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,851
And that's it.

212
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:22,422
Now people who are sensitive to motion
would enjoy our game.

213
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:27,494
To recap, get started
with the Apple Accessibility plugin

214
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:31,932
by cloning the GitHub repository
linked in this session's resources.

215
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,603
Add accessibility elements
so that people can use VoiceOver

216
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:38,805
and Switch Control with your games.

217
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,943
Adapt your text size with Dynamic Type.

218
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:46,947
And check for UI accommodations

219
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,250
so everyone can have a great experience
with your game.

220
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,620
Thank you so much for joining me.

221
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:57,624
We look forward to seeing how you make
games available for everyone

222
00:15:57,658 --> 00:16:00,961
with a great accessibility experience.
