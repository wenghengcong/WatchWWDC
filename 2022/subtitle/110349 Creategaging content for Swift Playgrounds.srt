00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:12,012
Hi.
I'm Stephanie Angulo.

3
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,814
and I'm Marcus Jackson.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,550
We're software engineers
on the Swift Playgrounds Content team.

5
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,885
Today, we will give you
the tools to create

6
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:20,187
engaging content for Swift Playgrounds.

7
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:24,291
Swift Playgrounds 4 introduced
app development on iPad and Mac.

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,594
It's the best way to learn
about building apps for the App Store.

9
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,631
Our team has released a number
of tutorial and sample code products

10
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,267
that help you learn the fundamentals
of app development.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,935
We cover topics like

12
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,705
building dynamic SwiftUI apps
using observable data models,

13
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,442
customizing views with fun
SwiftUI animations and shapes,

14
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,679
and more advanced topics,
like asynchronous data fetching.

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,115
In today's session,
we'll provide an overview

16
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,083
of our new instructional system,

17
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,819
write content
using the project's guide module,

18
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:57,791
and build an immersive learning experience
with walkthrough and experiment tasks.

19
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,159
Let's get started.

20
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:02,729
Imagine a learner completing our tutorial,
"Keep Going with Apps."

21
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,831
They'll end up with an app called,
"Emoji App."

22
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:09,703
In this app, they can keep track
of all their favorite animals in a list,

23
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,574
change their color and size,

24
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,742
and tap on the animals
to watch them get their groove on

25
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,411
in "Creature Dance" view.

26
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,348
This dance view is fun,
but I want the vibe to be

27
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,850
more of an actual dance party.

28
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,719
So let's go ahead and add some extra
features we can show our learners.

29
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:30,290
Here, I added a bit more code
to "Creature Dance" view.

30
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:32,593
Every party needs a dance floor.

31
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:35,863
So I made a 10x10 grid
that I set as my view's background.

32
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,566
And each tile in the grid
updates its color randomly

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,735
using a custom view modifier.

34
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,304
Looks groovy huh?

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,976
I also wanted to make sure
our favorite animals can dance

36
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,478
without our help,
so I made a few more custom modifiers

37
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:57,251
that help animate the animals' scale,
position offset, and rotation.

38
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:02,489
In all of these custom modifiers,
these animations are set to repeatForever,

39
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:06,193
which means our animals can dance
all night on their brand-new dance floor.

40
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,630
And finally,
to really light up the dance floor,

41
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,432
I added an animated disco ball
at the top of our view.

42
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,036
Adding this final touch
really pulls it all together

43
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,038
for the ultimate dance party.

44
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,873
I've made quite a few changes
to this project,

45
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,776
and I didn't even to dive into the details
of custom view modifiers.

46
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,379
So how should we explain this
to our learners?

47
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,748
You could direct a learner
to Apple's documentation,

48
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,284
but now you also have
the option to teach these concepts

49
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,220
alongside your project's code
in Swift Playgrounds.

50
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,189
Our team has built
this new instructional system

51
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,157
that's designed to help authors like you

52
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:40,794
create engaging in-app experiences
for your learners.

53
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,330
Today, we'll walk you through
how to build the learning content

54
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,332
for this app in Swift Playgrounds 4.

55
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,368
Let me give you a sneak peek
of what you'll be walking away with.

56
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,904
When a learner first opens
your content on Swift Playgrounds,

57
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:53,974
you can introduce them to the project
with an optional welcome message,

58
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,010
as shown here from our friend Byte.

59
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,680
The welcome message sits at the top
of the project's source editor

60
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,082
on the left hand side of the screen,

61
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,818
while on the right hand side
of the screen is the learning center.

62
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,389
The learning center is a designated area
where you can add images

63
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:12,492
and instructional text that describes
your content to your learners.

64
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,929
In our welcome message
and our learning center,

65
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,799
we're letting our learners know that this
project will be pumping up the jams

66
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,269
with the help of SwiftUI colors,
shapes, and animations.

67
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,907
The learning center also contains
a section for tasks.

68
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,144
Tasks are coding objectives you the author
can write to help guide your learners.

69
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,547
They're a fundamental
building block for content.

70
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,850
By tapping a task button
in the learning center,

71
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,052
our instructional system will open up
a Swift file

72
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:42,723
and render a card with learning material
at the top of that file.

73
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:48,829
This card can contain a series of pages
with text, images, and code snippets.

74
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,832
Later, Marcus will go over
two tasks types:

75
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:54,368
walkthroughs and experiments.

76
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:58,739
At a high level, that's what
our instructional system has to offer.

77
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,941
With the right prose and the right tasks,

78
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:05,012
you can build a compelling
educational experience for your learners.

79
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,214
Now, in order to start
creating your own content,

80
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,483
we first need to talk
about the guide module.

81
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:12,586
By default,
the file structure of a swiftpm project

82
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,488
keeps all its source code at its root.

83
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,989
In order to upgrade your project

84
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:17,891
to take advantage
of the instructional system,

85
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,194
you'll need to change its file structure.

86
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,563
We first need to create an App module.

87
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,265
Once it's created, we need to move
all our project's source code

88
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,934
and assets into it.

89
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,937
The Package.swift file should be
left at the root of our project.

90
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,341
Then we need to create a guide module.

91
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:39,079
This module should be at the same level
as the App module and Package.swift file.

92
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,982
Inside the guide module,
you'll need a guide file.

93
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,285
This file will include all the prose
of your learning content.

94
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,887
I've already started on my guide file,

95
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,256
so let's check out the content
I've written so far.

96
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,795
The guide file contains a combination
of directives and markdown.

97
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,698
Directives are an extension of markdown
that can take in primitive types

98
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,401
as attributes, such as strings,
as well as more complex types,

99
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,604
like markdown elements
and other directives.

100
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,007
Directives can act as containers
for other directives,

101
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,111
but they can also represent UI elements
in our instructional system.

102
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,248
First in the guide file, I've added
the necessary guidebook directive

103
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,550
that's wrapped
around the entirety of the file.

104
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,753
It acts as the main container
for all our directives.

105
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,223
Its parameters include a title,
icon and background image,

106
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:26,727
and the file you first want opened
when you open the project.

107
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,163
Under the guidebook directive,
I've added a welcome message directive.

108
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,666
Welcome messages are optional
and as mentioned earlier,

109
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,603
they are presented to the learner
when they first open up the project.

110
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:39,873
Below the welcome message directive,
I've added a guide directive

111
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,909
that's wrapped around a step directive.

112
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,378
The guide directive acts as a container
for your steps

113
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,812
and steps map out to your content

114
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,615
displayed in the learning center
and tasks.

115
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,685
To start adding images and instructional
text in your learning center,

116
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,888
you'll need to include a ContentAndMedia
directive inside your step.

117
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,725
So I got this party started
by adding a dance floor,

118
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,795
a nice welcome message,
and the prose for the learning center.

119
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,797
Marcus,
do you wanna keep this party going?

120
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,532
Marcus: Definitely.

121
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,202
What a dope dance floor
for our creatures to party on.

122
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:11,405
While this effect is really cool,
I think it might be too much

123
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,307
for someone who is still learning.

124
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,077
To help explain this code,
we can use walkthrough tasks.

125
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,479
Let's start with a one-page walkthrough.

126
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:22,583
Later, I'll show you
how to fill out the rest.

127
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,519
Stephanie already showed you
the beginnings of our guidebook,

128
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,721
as well as a helpful welcome message.

129
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,591
We already have the first directive
you need to create tasks,

130
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,226
the step directive.

131
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,562
The step directive is where
our walkthrough content will live.

132
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:39,166
To make a step, you need to fill it
with two other directives.

133
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,703
Here, we've already added
a content and media directive.

134
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,973
This directive contains markdown
that goes into the learning center

135
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,574
on the right hand side.

136
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:51,578
The body of this directive can contain
any form of markdown text.

137
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,481
This is the place to put longer prose
and larger images

138
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,617
that might help cover your topic.

139
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,654
Here is the content and media directive
being displayed in Playgrounds.

140
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,856
While the area seems small
in this example,

141
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,060
this view can extend further down
and is contained in a scroll view.

142
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,963
This makes it a great place
to write longer bits of prose

143
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:13,400
and show complex content such as diagrams.

144
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,836
Once you have
your content and media written,

145
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,273
we can add in the second
required directive, tasks.

146
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:23,277
We add our tasks into another directive
called a task group.

147
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,047
Task groups are an optional directive
you can put inside of steps,

148
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,850
if you want to collect
a group of tasks together.

149
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:33,086
You might consider this if you have
content which covers the same topic

150
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,957
across multiple files
or different types of tasks.

151
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,194
Within the task group,
we can add a short bit of text.

152
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,263
This will be displayed
in the learning center as a subtitle.

153
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,234
Here is how a task group
displays in Playgrounds.

154
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,338
Now that I have
my task group and my subtitle,

155
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:54,575
I can start adding task directives.

156
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,810
Tasks have a few parameters

157
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,579
The first parameter is type.

158
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,214
This lets the instructional system know

159
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,684
what UI to generate
when displaying this task.

160
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,453
Next, every task needs an ID.

161
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,956
IDs are strings
that can be anything you want.

162
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,593
However, every ID in the guide
must be unique.

163
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,329
The title parameter is also a string.

164
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,866
This can also be whatever you want
and does not have to be unique.

165
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,935
This title will be rendered
by the task card UI.

166
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,671
Finally, the file parameter tells
the learning center

167
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:29,142
which file in the project to open
when the learner starts this task.

168
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,145
Here is how
a task displays on Playgrounds.

169
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,314
The title sits inside of a button,

170
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,950
and the file of the walkthrough
is listed above it.

171
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,520
Now we have our walkthrough task written.

172
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,655
Let's add our first page.

173
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,124
Page directives go
inside the body of a task

174
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,994
and have the following
mandatory parameters:

175
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,330
The ID parameter behaves
just like the ID for a task,

176
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,667
so they must be unique
for the entire guide file.

177
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,637
The title parameter behaves
a lot like the one for tasks.

178
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,107
However, when you leave
the title string empty on a page,

179
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,075
this lets the instructional system know

180
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:05,479
to use the task's title
when displaying this page.

181
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,649
Inside of a page,
you can add any markdown text,

182
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,118
similar to the content
and media directive.

183
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,855
However, the task view is
much smaller than the learning center.

184
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,492
Keep your text short and avoid
using complex images like diagrams

185
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,328
because they may be hard
for the learner to read.

186
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:25,065
This is the first page of our walkthrough
as rendered by Swift Playgrounds.

187
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,434
We're almost done
with our first walkthrough,

188
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,970
but first I need to show you
how to highlight the code

189
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:33,040
as shown in the last screenshot.

190
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,743
For that, we need to add some markers
to CreatureDance.swift.

191
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,545
When my walkthrough is shown,

192
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,848
I'd like to highlight
the first custom modifier,

193
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,317
the animatedScalingEffect.

194
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,954
To add highlights to a line,
I'll add a pair of comments on the lines

195
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,389
before and after the code.

196
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:53,427
We start with the multiline
comment syntax, /*

197
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,231
Inside the comment,
we write #-code

198
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:01,635
-walkthrough,
followed by a pair of parentheses.

199
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,704
Inside the parentheses, we write the ID

200
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,906
of the page directive
we want to highlight.

201
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,575
In this case, 1.modifier.

202
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,679
Now, let's test this out in Playgrounds.

203
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,215
Let's open the Emoji App project.

204
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,221
When you open the project,
you're greeted with the source editor

205
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:23,957
on the left and the preview on the right.

206
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,560
Above the source editor
is our welcome message,

207
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:30,831
where our buddy Byte gives you an overview
of what learning content there is to do.

208
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,066
I'll tap on the Learn More button.

209
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,940
The preview on the right
is swapped out for the learning center.

210
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,744
At the top is the prose we wrote
in the ContentAndMedia directive.

211
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,946
Below that is the task group,

212
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,183
as well as the button
with the title of our walkthrough.

213
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,818
Walkthroughs are denoted
in the learning center as buttons

214
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:55,589
with pictures of another one
of Byte's friends, Expert.

215
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,460
Tapping on this button does a few things:

216
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:04,298
First, the learning center is once again
swapped out for the preview.

217
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,734
Second, if it isn't already open,
the file specified

218
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:11,104
in the task's file parameter
is opened in the source editor.

219
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:14,975
Third, the task view drops down
above the source editor.

220
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,878
Finally, the source editor highlights
the code marked

221
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,880
in the code walkthrough comments.

222
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:23,584
If the content is not on screen,
the source editor will scroll

223
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:27,020
until the lines of code that need
to be highlighted appear.

224
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:30,257
And that is how you write
a walkthrough in Swift Playgrounds,

225
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,359
but I think it's fair to say
you're probably curious

226
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,162
what a walkthrough
with multiple pages looks like.

227
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:39,833
To do that, I'll open the project in Xcode
to fill out the rest of my walkthrough.

228
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,638
Now with the guide file open in Xcode,
I'd like to add a couple more pages

229
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,139
to my walkthrough.

230
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,276
I've explained a little bit
about what a view modifier is,

231
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,146
but I'd like to explain more
about how to build a custom view modifier.

232
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,182
I'll go ahead and add those pages.

233
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,888
Great.

234
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:04,091
Now we have our walkthrough
for custom view modifiers.

235
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:08,762
I think now is also a good time
to explain the ViewModifier protocol.

236
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:13,433
This way, learners can try to make
their own ViewModifiers if they want to.

237
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,436
To do this, I'll add another walkthrough
to our task group.

238
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,210
We now have
a fully fleshed out pair of walkthroughs.

239
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,213
I'll switch back over to my iPad
to see how it looks.

240
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,583
When we open our project,

241
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,019
there are now two walkthroughs
in the learning center.

242
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,788
I'll start by tapping
on the first walkthrough.

243
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:40,694
Just like before,
the line with the view modifier highlights

244
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:44,498
and our task view drops down
to explain what this code is.

245
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,700
Now I can tap the next button.

246
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,506
The source editor now scrolls down
to the modifier struct

247
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,209
and explains what this struct is for.

248
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:02,416
Tapping on the next button again moves
to the final page of this walkthrough,

249
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:06,687
which explains more about the body method
inside the modifier struct.

250
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,158
In the bottom corner of the task view,
there is a button marked Next Walkthrough.

251
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:17,898
Tapping on this automatically begins
the next walkthrough task.

252
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:21,602
This functionality is given to you
for free by the instructional system

253
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,438
as long as there is another task
to progress to.

254
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,908
Now that I am here, I will tap
through the rest of this walkthrough.

255
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,884
And that is how you build walkthroughs
in Swift Playgrounds.

256
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:40,354
Next, I'd like to show you how to create
a different kind of task

257
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:44,424
that will allow learners to try adding
code themselves and seeing what happens.

258
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,561
So at this point,
we have a good party going.

259
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:51,098
Our creatures are dancing, and they have
some lights in the background.

260
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,200
While it basically looks
like a nightclub in there,

261
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,636
I think we can do a little bit better.

262
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,372
I think it would be great
to add some colors to our creatures

263
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,909
so it looks like they're dancing under
the strobe lights of their little club.

264
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,878
But that's just me. What would you do?

265
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:08,115
This is where experiment tasks come in.

266
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:12,152
Experiments are optional bits of code
learners can add

267
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,021
if they are feeling extra curious

268
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:17,558
or if they want a way
of making the app unique to them.

269
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:20,961
Back in the guide file,
we can add our experiment task

270
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,630
to the same step
we were already working on.

271
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:26,600
I've created a new task group
to hold our experiments

272
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,969
which I've named "Experiments."

273
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,839
I've populated it with a subtitle
as well as the beginnings

274
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,674
of our first experiment task.

275
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:38,545
The first difference between
an experiment task and a walkthrough

276
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,914
is what goes into the type parameter.

277
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:45,252
The other parameters follow
a similar convention to walkthrough tasks.

278
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,522
Page directives work the same way
they do in walkthroughs.

279
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:53,861
However, for experiments, we add
one optional parameter, isAddable.

280
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:57,297
The isAddable parameter allows
experiment tasks to add code

281
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:59,633
directly into the source editor.

282
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,536
When isAddable is set to true,
an add button appears

283
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,506
in the learning task card
next to the code snippet.

284
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:08,442
The code in a page directive
must be wrapped in a code block

285
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:11,111
using the triple back tick
markdown syntax.

286
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:15,148
It's best practice to keep
your code blocks to ten lines or less.

287
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:18,452
While the task view can show
longer code snippets if need be,

288
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:21,221
it's better
if learners don't have to scroll.

289
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,191
Here is how the code view
displays in Playgrounds.

290
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,560
To the right of the code snippet,
is an add button,

291
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:30,030
since the isAddable parameter
was set to true.

292
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:33,600
That is almost everything we need
to write an experiment task.

293
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:35,769
But remember that isAddable parameter?

294
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:39,806
This allows the experiment task
to add code to the source editor,

295
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,310
but we need to tell Playgrounds
where in the code to add the snippet.

296
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:47,114
Here we are again in CreatureDance.swift.

297
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:51,785
I want learners to add the color modifier
right below the opacity modifier.

298
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:55,455
So that's where I'll add
my experiment task comment.

299
00:15:55,489 --> 00:16:00,561
Experiment task comments are single line,
meaning they start with a double slash.

300
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:06,033
Then, we write #-
learning-task.

301
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,468
After, comes a pair of parentheses,

302
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:12,239
and inside we write the ID
of the experiment task.

303
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:16,510
Now we have everything we need
to test out our experiment task.

304
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:20,547
Once again, I have all this
already written in the swiftpm project

305
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:22,382
Stephanie and I are working on.

306
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,084
Let's check it out.

307
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,787
We're back once again
to the learning center.

308
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,957
This time I want to focus
on the bottom task group,

309
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,992
where our first experiment is.

310
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,761
Experiments are noted
in the instructional system

311
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,397
by another one of Byte's friends, Blu.

312
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,433
Let's tap on the experiment task.

313
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,971
What happens next should seem familiar.

314
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,739
The task view drops down.

315
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:49,276
However, this time,
the task view contains a code view.

316
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,012
On the right of the code view
is an add button.

317
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:55,215
Tapping on this adds the code
right to the source editor.

318
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,253
With the code now added,
I'd like to check out

319
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,722
what changes that made
to the CreatureDanceView.

320
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,590
Let's start this party!

321
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,227
Sweet.

322
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:09,563
Now we can see the lights
hitting our creatures.

323
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:13,000
This is pretty groovy, but I think
we can take it up one more notch

324
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:17,271
by using a timer to give the creatures
a random color every few seconds.

325
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:20,174
To do that, we'll need to add
another experiment,

326
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,610
so let's take this project back to Xcode
and add our new task.

327
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:25,746
Before we add in our second experiment,

328
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:30,250
I think it's a good idea to add a page
to the experiment that's already there.

329
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:33,320
For a learner,
it can be confusing to add a block of code

330
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,956
and not know why or what it does.

331
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:40,594
To help with that, I'll add a page
with some text before our code page.

332
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:49,870
Now, we are ready to add our second task.

333
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,807
Again, I want the learner
to add some code to their project,

334
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:58,512
so I'll add a page explaining the code
followed by an addable code snippet.

335
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:03,450
And with that, we have made
a new piece of content to teach learners

336
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:07,487
about some of the things you can do
with custom view modifiers.

337
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:10,157
Hey, Stephanie, you ready to show them
what we've built?

338
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,525
Stephanie: Yeah, let's do it.

339
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,362
I'll open the final version of our content
on my iPad

340
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:18,198
and check out how my changes
and Marcus' changes flow together.

341
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:20,100
When I first open the project,

342
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:23,937
the welcome message animates in,
introducing us to Creature Party.

343
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:27,441
When I tap on the Learn More button
in the welcome message,

344
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,643
it opens the learning center for me.

345
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:30,511
Awesome.

346
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,546
Our learning center does have
my description at the top

347
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,481
and the four tasks Marcus added.

348
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:36,416
Let's tap on the first walkthrough.

349
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:40,320
Here, Marcus used
my AnimatedScalingModifier

350
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:43,590
as an example to explain
how to use custom view modifiers.

351
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:49,763
When I tap on the Next Walkthrough Button,
the second walkthrough animates in.

352
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:56,003
Marcus used the View Modifier protocol as
an example to describe how protocols work.

353
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:58,639
After finishing the second walkthrough,
when I tap Done,

354
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,908
the first experiment task segues in.

355
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,945
The Dancing in the Strobe Light task
tells me

356
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,648
I can add some color to our creatures
by adding this code snippet

357
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:10,050
containing a colorMultiply modifier.

358
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,486
Let's remind ourselves
what this dance party looks like

359
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,121
before adding the code snippet.

360
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,791
All right, cool.

361
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,027
I'll add the code snippet by tapping Add

362
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,529
and tap Start the Party again
to check out the changes.

363
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,934
Nice, the creatures changed color.

364
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:30,337
I'll complete this experiment task now
and transition to the last one.

365
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:34,942
The Switch It Up experiment task
tells me I can customize the color

366
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:37,377
of the animals
with a tap gesture and a timer.

367
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:40,414
I'll add the code snippet
and start the party once more.

368
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:45,118
And now when I tap on the animals,
they change color.

369
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,753
Nice.

370
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:49,957
I'll complete this last task
and head back to the learning center.

371
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,962
Now, all tasks are marked as completed
in the learning center,

372
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:56,763
which means we've completed this sample.

373
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,801
And that's how you take advantage
of our new content features

374
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:02,336
in Swift Playgrounds 4.

375
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,571
We hope you enjoyed today's session
and we're so excited

376
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:06,540
to see what sorts
of learning experiences you'll build.

377
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:09,009
Don't forget to check out
the other Swift Playgrounds session,

378
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,211
Build your First App in Swift Playgrounds.

379
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:12,713
Enjoy the rest of WWDC.

380
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:16,083
Marcus: And now, if you'll excuse us,
we have a party to attend.
